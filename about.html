 	<h1>About</h1>
 	<p>	Artistic Styles is a web  design company in the US. Its main business is creating webpages that can run  well, but still look good. And unlike other web design companies that ask for  way too much, Artistic Styles is affordable but still has the quality of an  expensive webpage. The company develops and markets website design, graphic  design, logo design, branding development, social media marketing &amp; SEO,  custom mapping, printing (business cards, postcards, and brochures) and also  focuses on animation and media.</p>
 	<p>Our strengths are  creating good looking web pages that are clean and easy to navigate. They are  able to be changed later on without any coding knowledge. Our company also  gives the same quality for half the price of other leading companies.</p>
